For this Hackathon, you can use any kinds of publicly available data, i.e. any data that is officially shared with the public by the Texas A&M University or other institutions. **All teams must use at least some data provided by TAMU Data and Research Services**, but you can also augment with additional data sources like the following examples from 2 to 5.

For example:

1.[TAMU Data and Research Services](http://dars.tamu.edu/Data-and-Reports/Student) & 
[University Metrics](https://accountability.tamu.edu/content/university-metrics)

Some reports have been converted to .csv files in [1999-2014_Enrollment Profile](https://github.com/HackathonTAMU/04.04.14_Diversity_Open_Data_Hackathon/tree/master/Data/1999-2014_Enrollment%20Profile) folder.
